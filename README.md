# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me
🎓 I am Jake Schaefbauer, a **Full Stack Web Developer** and I love trying to figure out why certain code blocks don't work and enjoy the rush of finally figuring out what the problem was! I just receive my certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Minnesota!

👨‍💻 Outside of coding I enjoy watching a wide variety of sports, but I primarily follow **football (American)**, **hockey**, **basketball**, and **Formula 1 racing**. My hobbies include **playing hockey**, **going to the gym**, and **building computers**.

📚 I enjoy reading books on **self-development** and my favorite book is **Atomic Habits** by _James Clear_ which focuses on breaking bad habits and creating good ones.

I am also a **foodie** and always looking for the best "hole in the wall" restaurants
